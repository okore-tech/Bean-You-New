        TERMS AND CONDITIONS – ASILI COFFEE GROUP FOUNDATION and BEAN YOU
token allocation.
1. Introduction
1.1 1.2 1.3 1.4 These terms and conditions (the “T&Cs”) govern the basis on which you, (“you”
or the “Contributor”), can make a contribution (a “Contribution”) to the Asili
Coffee Group Foundation (“we” or “ASILIF”).
These T&Cs also set out the procedure for the subsequent allocation to you of
transferable cryptographic blockchain-based digital information units, each called
a Bean You token (“BEANYOU”) which is a derivative of the Seratio Token
(“SER”). The Seratio Token has been established on the Ethereum Network, but
the BEANYOU token is on the Solana network. These T&Cs also cover the purchase
of intangible Real World Assets (iRWA).
You need to read these T&Cs carefully, and should keep a copy for future
reference.
We have defined terms in these T&Cs as they are used. However please note the
following definitions:
Collaborating Entity: ASILIF has separate agreements to provide contracted
services and BEANYOU POINTS to other Collaborating Entities including the farms.
Where there is no Collaborating Entity contributions will be fully held by ASILIF.
Fiat Money: This means fiat money that is money made legal tender by a
government decree.
BEAN YOU POINTS: We have devised a separate non-financial token, the BEAN
YOU POINTS which is a derivative of the Microshare (MCR), a token based on the
Ethereum Chain Network which represents the transaction of a non-financial
attribute value for example gained through volunteering, ESG (Environmental
Social Governance), social credits, being a care giver, buying products with
positive provenance, shopping in the “good” retailer, and similar activities. BEAN
YOU POINTS can be transacted through the BEANYOU/iRWA but do not have to
be featured in any BEANYOU transaction as a rule and are simply optional.
Similarly, BEANYOU could only transact BEAN YOU POINTS on some occasion,
with no financial value. The Bean You Platform will be a ledger for both financial
value and Bean You Points. Bean You points can be credited to your BEANYOU-
Wallet through many ways including physical loyalty cards. They can also be
transferred into other reward mechanisms to gain benefit. Bean You Points are a
feature and store of non-financial value. They can be used as a discount or gifted
in their own right;
BEANYOU: This is a transferable cryptographic blockchain-based digital
information unit token . BEANYOU is a token designed to transact your financial
value based on the non-financial values that you hold. such as “good” beliefs.
BEANYOU does not represent or constitute any ownership right or stake, share or
security or equivalent right in or relating to ASILIF, the Bean You platform, and/or
any software, any public or private company, corporation, entity or property; and
Bean You Platform: This platform is planned to be developed from the proceeds
of the contributions to us. The platform will have the capability to record a non-
financial score/attribute as part of any transaction.
ASIlIF T&C 28 July 2025

Bean You Wallet: is the initial repository for BEANYOU and Bean You Points.
Software: this refers to the underlying software application and software
platform BEANYOU is based on, including the Bean You Platform the BEANYOU-
Wallet and the Ethereum or Solana Network, as well as any other relevant
software, technology and technical concepts.
Intangible Real World Assets: this is the tokenization of intangible real world
assets (iRWA) such as ESG (Environmental Social Governance) rights attributed
to a tangible asset. It does not apply to the tokenization of tangible Real World
Assets.
Social Impact: This is the social impact as measured by the Social Earnings
Ratio®. The value of BEANYOU token is a function of the social impact received by
the participating farms participating in the iRWA.
2. 2.1 2.2 Risks of making a Contribution
You should only make a Contribution in return for BEANYOU if you are happy with
the risks of doing so. We are undertaking a relatively new type of fundraising.
There may, therefore, be unforeseen risks of which we are currently unaware.
The usual risks involved in making this type of Contribution, and with the
allocation, use and ownership of BEANYOU are set out below. You should read
these carefully and only make a Contribution if you are comfortable with accepting
these risks:
2.2.1 2.2.2 2.2.3 Risk of software weaknesses: The Software is still in an early
development stage and unproven. This means that:
2.2.1.1 we cannot warranty that the process for receipt, use and
ownership of BEANYOU will be uninterrupted or error-free;
and
2.2.1.2 there is an inherent risk that the software and related
technologies and theories we use could contain
weaknesses, vulnerabilities or bugs (“Glitches”). Glitches
could cause, inter alia, complete loss of BEANYOU and/or
Ethereum/Solana Network.
Regulatory risk: crypto-currency and the underlying blockchain
technology is currently subject to relatively light regulatory oversight.
This is, however, subject to change. In the future, certain regulators or
other governmental authorities may impose or extend regulations which
could apply to either of these technologies. These regulations may have
a negative impact on the current set-up of BEANYOU or the underlying
Ethereum or Solana Network on which BEANYOU is based. These
regulations could result in substantial modifications of the Software.
There is also a risk that regulatory developments could cause their
termination and the consequential loss of your BEANYOU.
Risk of abandonment / lack of success: The allocation of BEANYOU
and the development of the Bean You Platform may be abandoned for
a number of reasons, including:
ASIlIF T&C 28 July 2025
2
2.2.4 2.2.5 2.2.6 2.2.7 2.2.8 2.2.3.1 lack of interest from industry;
2.2.3.2 lack of interest from the public;
2.2.3.3 lack of funding; or
2.2.3.4 lack of commercial success or prospects (for example, as a
result of competing projects).
This means that, even if the Bean You Platform is partially or fully
developed and launched, you may not receive any functionality through
the BEANYOU or Bean You Points you hold.
Risk of loss of private key: BEANYOU may only be accessed using a
private key that corresponds to the address at which it is stored. If your
private key, or the “seed” used to create your address and
corresponding private key is lost or stolen, your BEANYOU associated
with that address will be unrecoverable and will be permanently lost.
Risk of theft: The Software may be attacked by hackers or other
individuals. If successful, such attacks could result in the theft or loss
of BEANYOU, or the theft or loss of your Contributions, as well as impact
our ability to develop and launch the Bean You Platform.
Risk of blockchain mining attacks: As with other public blockchain-
based systems that depend on independent miners, the Ethereum
Network may be susceptible to mining attacks. These attacks may occur
in a wide range of forms, and include but are not limited to:
2.2.6.1 double-spend attacks,
2.2.6.2 majority mining power attacks,
2.2.6.3 “selfish-mining” attacks, and
2.2.6.4 race condition attacks.
Any successful attacks are a risk to the Ethereum or Solana Networks,
the expected proper execution and sequencing of BEANYOU
transactions, and the expected proper execution and sequencing of
software computations.
Liquidity risk: Bean You is a new form of token currency and so market
liquidity is not guaranteed and the value of Bean You over time (if any)
may experience extreme volatility or depreciate in full. Lack of liquidity
may cause difficulty in obtaining value should you decide to sell
BEANYOU, or indeed may make it difficult for you to sell your BEANYOU
at all;
General economic risks: Please be aware that the value of BEANYOU
can fall as well as rise. You may not get back the full amount of your
Contribution should you sell your BEANYOU. The value of BEANYOU may
depend on fluctuations in the financial markets, or other economic
factors, which are outside our control. The past performance of other
cryptographic tokens is not necessarily a guide to the future
performance of BEANYOU.
ASIlIF T&C 28 July 2025

2.3 3. 3.1 3.2 3.3 4. 4.1 4.2 As long as we have acted in good faith, we do not accept responsibility for any of
the risks set out above, to the maximum extent allowed by law, as we view you
accepting these as part of your decision whether to make a Contribution.
Audit of the BEANYOU Token Code
Technical experts have, on a reasonable efforts basis, audited and approved the
Software and BEANYOU/iRWA code with regard to their functionality, accuracy
and security standards. Those experts have confirmed the BEANYOU Token Code
(the “Code”) has been programmed according to the most currently available
security practices and standards.
However, the software and technology that we have used is still in an early
development stage. Its application is of an experimental nature which carries
significant operational, technological, financial, regulatory and reputational risks.
Therefore, while the audit raises the level of security and accuracy, you
understand and accept that it does not amount to any form of warranty, either
direct or indirect, that the Code does not contain any weaknesses, vulnerabilities
or bugs which could cause, for example, the complete loss of BEANYOU and/or
Ethereum/Solana Networks.
Conditions for making a Contribution
You may not make a Contribution if you are a US citizen, or a person or entity
permanently resident in the US or any of its territories. In the event you do make
a Contribution where you are any of the above, you accept any and all risks, costs
and damages associated with making a Contribution.
